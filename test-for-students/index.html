                        “I'm going to follow you, Rudy.”
                        From Furyu with sculpting by Moineau comes a 1/7 scale 
                        figure of Sylphiette from the popular anime Mushoku Tensei:
                         Jobless Reincarnation! Measuring 6.7", she stands in 
                         an energetic pose with her hand outstretched, and her
                         cute design has been faithfully captured in figure form
                          down to her short green hair, long elf ears, and 
                          bright, innocent smile. Her outfit has been carefully
                          sculpted as well down to the texture of the materials
                          and the wrinkles that emphasize her movement, and each
                        layer features details, from the way her oversized coat 
                        flutters to the black strap of her innerwear peeking out 
                        from under her shirt. Cute from every angle, don't miss 
                        out on adding her to your collection!
