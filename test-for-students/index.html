            The only thing better than meatballs is cheesy stuffed meatballs 
            that ooze out ooey gooey mozzarella with every bite! Paired with 
            the creamy “vodka” sauce, this recipe is packed with all sorts of 
            flavors and textures yet it all comes together in a little over 
            30 minutes. It is the definition of an indulgent dinner that can 
            be enjoyed with pasta or some garlic bread!

            PREP THE MEATBALLS
        </h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs and milk. Allow it to 
                soak for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li> 
                To a medium bowl, add the soaked breadcrumbs, ground beef, 
                garlic, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, Italian seasoning, 
                paprika, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and onion powder. 
                Mix together to combine well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shape the meatballs into round small balls, about 3 tablespoons 
                of meat each.
            </li>
            <li>
                Push a small cube of mozzarella into the center of each meatball 
                and roll the meatball to seal it up tightly. Repeat with the 
                rest to stuff them.
            </li>

        <h5>
            MAKE THE VODKA SAUCE
        </h5>

            <li>
                In a saucepan, add the olive oil over medium heat. 
                Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 
                4 to 5 minutes. The tomato paste will darken in color from a 
                bright red to reddish brown. This process removes acidity from 
                the tomato paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add heavy cream and mix until incorporated. Simmer for about 
                2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the red pepper flakes, dried basil, salt, and black pepper 
                to taste. Mix again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the grated parmesan, and butter. Mix until the sauce is 
                smooth and creamy. Take off the heat and set aside.
            </li>
        <br>
        
        <h5>
            COOK THE MEATBALLS
        </h5>
        
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add a 
                drizzle of olive oil to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the meatballs on the pan, spacing them apart. Allow one 
                side to sear, about 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate. Once the other 
                side is browned too, drop the heat to low and allow it to cook 
                through until done, 165 degrees in the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the meatballs to the vodka sauce and serve warm 
                to enjoy!
